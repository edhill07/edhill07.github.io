                        LLMs are great for researching and finding information – looking at documents directly, or quickly summing up tens of thousands of words of search results (this is "RAG") – but how do we know they're doing it well? Are their answers accurate? Have they captured everything?

                        Looking at the evaluation of knowledge extraction and synthesis frameworks in general, and RAG in particular, using GRACE – a multi-agent RAG framework – for research and deployment. We are looking at systematic evaluation of the novel features of GRACE and comparison to similar systems, and at how evaluation at a query level can be performed and played back to the user.

                        The BM25 method has been around about 50 years now but is still a great way to find information – basically like doing Ctrl+F, but with corrections such as weighting towards rarer words. It's fast, robust and explainable – how can we make it better?

                    <div class="project-description">
                        GRACE uses search techniques which extend BM25. A baseline BM25 (Lucene, with stemming) benefits from low import times and good performance – particularly with rare or domain specific words. This work looks at domain specific query expansion, particularly for providing context for RAG, so evaluation of it overlaps with the work above.

                        Word embeddings represent words as vectors of numbers, where the relative positions of those vectors have meaning. There are now much more sophisticated ways of representing words in context within a sentence, so results won't be state-of-the-art, but it's interesting to look at how representations are formed, and novel ways of doing that.

                        Finding word embeddings as fixed points of forward mappings – explicitly, defining simple forward mapping to a word from its neighbours, with negative sampling becoming orthonormalization. Usefulness of this (it needs little data), quality and flavour of the embeddings (word level and on MTEB – some capture semantic features and others achieve the aim of being more like dependency-based ones), and links to the query expansion above. I'm also interested in lightweight, and training free, attention.

                                We investigate whether the hidden states of large language models (LLMs) can be used to estimate and impute economic and financial statistics. Focusing on county-level (e.g. unemployment) and firm-level (e.g. total assets) variables, we show that a simple linear model trained on the hidden states of open-source LLMs outperforms the models' text outputs. This suggests that hidden states capture richer economic information than the responses of the LLMs reveal directly.

                                For simple classification tasks, we show that users can benefit from the advantages of using small, local, generative language models instead of large commercial models without a trade-off in performance or introducing extra labelling costs. Through experiments on 17 sentence classification tasks (2-4 classes), we show that penalised logistic regression on the embeddings from a small LLM equals (and usually betters) the performance of a large LLM in the "tens-of-shot" regime.

                                Once the stuff of science fiction, quantum technologies are advancing fast. Individual quantum computers are finding a range of applications, primarily driven by the immense speed-ups they offer over normal computers. This blog post starts to think about what this new interconnected quantum world means for the financial system. What could the first 'quantum markets' look like?

                                General equilibrium macroeconomic models are a core tool used by policymakers to understand a nation's economy. We use techniques from reinforcement learning to solve such models incorporating heterogeneous agents in a way that is simple, extensible, and computationally efficient. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of heterogeneity in macroeconomic outcomes and the need for models that can more easily incorporate it.
